# C-Sharp Projects
 These projects were my introduction to C# and .NET Framework.

## Introduction
This repository contains the C# coding performed in the Tech Academy's software developer bootcamp, focused on building within the Visual Studio environment.


## Projects
[Blackjack Project](#blackjack-app)<br>
A Console App created in Visual Studio to reflect a game of Twenty-One!<br>
- The game logic was to request the user's name, get their gambling budget, ask for their wager, and then to randomly deal cards. 
- Conditional components of the game accounted for a variety of exceptions, ranging from preventing improper data entry in the console, to cutting off users whose wagers exceeded their gambling balance, to catching "negative" wagers (which could increase their balance on losses), logging those as fraud errors, and calling security!

[Car Insurance Project](#car-insurance-app)<br>
A Web App created in Visual Studio using the Model/ View/ Controller pattern ("MVC") and Entity Framework ("EF".) The Car Insurance website consisted of:
- <b>Insuree</b> page for drivers to enter all details to determine an insurance quote.
    - Logic was built in to start with a base rate, and conditionally adding to the quote based on the driver's age, the car year, model, make, driving record, and their coverage type.
- <b>Admin</b> page to solely display Name, Date of Birth, and Quote values that were constructed by the above logic.
